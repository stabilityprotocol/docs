### Global Trust Network (GTN) Transactions and API Key Requirement

When operating on the Global Trust Network, the free transaction policy available on the Testnet does not apply. Users are required to create an API Key through our **[Stability Portal](https://portal.stabilityprotocol.com)** for conducting transactions on the Global Trust Network. This key is a crucial component for accessing our Global Trust Network services, enabling users to securely and effectively manage their transactions.
