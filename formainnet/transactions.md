### Mainnet Transactions and API Key Requirement

When operating on the Mainnet, the free transaction policy available on the Testnet does not apply. Users are required to create an API Key through our **[Stability Portal](https://portal.stabilityprotocol.com)** for conducting transactions on the Mainnet. This key is a crucial component for accessing our Mainnet services, enabling users to securely and effectively manage their transactions.
