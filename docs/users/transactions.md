# About Our Free Transactions

## Introduction

One of the standout features of our blockchain platform is the implementation of zero gas price transactions. This initiative is part of our commitment to providing an efficient and cost-effective transaction experience. It allows users to execute transactions without the added burden of gas fees, which are a common expense in many other blockchain environments.

### Free Transactions on Testnet

As part of our dedication to user convenience and platform accessibility, we offer 25 free transactions per day to each address on our Testnet without registration. This daily allowance resets at 00:00 UTC. Users can easily monitor their transaction count and the reset timing by visiting the **[Stability Portal](https://portal.stabilityprotocol.com)** section of our Testnet platform. This feature is ideal for testing and development purposes, providing a risk-free environment to explore the capabilities of our blockchain. After an address has reached the allocated 25 free transactions, further transactions will fail until the daily allowance resets.

To expand your transaction limit on the Stability Testnet, simply register for an API Key through the **[Stability Portal](https://portal.stabilityprotocol.com)**. Each registered API key is allocated additional transaction allowances. For a detailed, step-by-step explanation on how to use an API key for transactions, please visit our  **[Getting Started](./getting_started.md)** user documentation. 


### Free Transactions on Global Trust Network (GTN)

Global Trust Network (GTN) offers free transactions with a registered API Key. The same process applies. Simply register for an API Key through the **[Stability Portal](https://portal.stabilityprotocol.com)**. Each registered API key is allocated additional transaction allowances.
