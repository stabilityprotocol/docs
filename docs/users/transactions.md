# About Our Free Transactions

## Introduction

One of the standout features of our blockchain platform is the implementation of zero gas price transactions, reflecting our commitment to providing an efficient and cost-effective transaction experience. This initiative allows users to execute transactions without the burden of gas fees, a common expense in many other blockchain environments.

### Free Transactions

We offer 1000 free transactions per month on our networks, available to each registered API key regardless of your plan. Users can monitor their transaction count and reset timing by visiting the **[Stability Portal](https://portal.stabilityprotocol.com)**. This feature is ideal for testing and development, providing a risk-free environment to explore the capabilities of our blockchain. For detailed instructions on using an API key for transactions, please refer to our **[Getting Started](./getting_started.md)** documentation.
