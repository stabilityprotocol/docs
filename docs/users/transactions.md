# About Our Free Transactions

## Introduction

One of the standout features of our blockchain platform is the implementation of zero gas price transactions, reflecting our commitment to providing an efficient and cost-effective transaction experience. This initiative allows users to execute transactions without the burden of gas fees, a common expense in many other blockchain environments.

### Free Transactions

We offer a limited number of free transactions per day on our Testnet, available to each registered API key. This daily allowance resets at 00:00 UTC. Users can monitor their transaction count and reset timing by visiting the **[Stability Portal](https://portal.stabilityprotocol.com)**. This feature is ideal for testing and development, providing a risk-free environment to explore the capabilities of our blockchain. Once an address reaches the allocated free transactions, further transactions will be restricted until the daily allowance resets. For detailed instructions on using an API key for transactions, please refer to our **[Getting Started](./getting_started.md)** documentation.

Similarly, the Global Trust Network (GTN) offers free transactions with a registered API Key, following the same process. Users can register for an API Key through the **[Stability Portal](https://portal.stabilityprotocol.com)** to receive additional transaction allowances. Detailed guides are also available in our **[Getting Started](./getting_started.md)** documentation.
