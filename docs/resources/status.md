# Network Status

The current Network Status, along with historical downtime records, is accessible on [Stability Protocol's Status Dashboard](https://status.stabilityprotocol.com/).

We are currently monitoring the block generation and public RPC endpoints for both the Stability Testnet and the Global Trust Network (GTN). Additionally, the uptime of our homepage and account portal is under continuous observation.
