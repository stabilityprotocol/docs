# Example Apps

The following are a list of example dApps created by the Stability Team.

## Stability Account Portal - Mainnet & Testnet
**Generates API Keys For Individual RPCs**
**Wallet Not Required**

A platform for creating free accounts to allow you to interact and perform transactions on the Stability Testnet and Global Trust Network. You can create an API key to use with an RPC URL for wallets such as MetaMask or create an account with MagicLink for a wallet-free experience.

For a walkthrough on this process, please visit our [**Getting Started**](../users/getting_started.md) tutorial. If you wish to interact with these apps, be sure to register with Stability Testnet.

## Stability Publisher - Mainnet & Testnet
**Demonstrates Data Publishing on Stability**
**Walletless**

A simple decentralized application (dApp) and React frontend that allows users to submit messages to the Stability Blockchain using our experimental [**ZKT RPC**](../developers/zkt.md), with the option to post to either the Testnet or Mainnet.

The Mintify app demonstrates the simplest web3 onboarding experience in the world today, possible with Stability. This revolutionary proof-of-concept enables a user to log in with an email address and automatically create a brand new, unfunded wallet and mint a digital collectible (NFT) onto the Stability Testnet Blockchain for free. No cryptocurrency, transaction fee, account abstraction, or sponsored transaction required â€” an industry first.
