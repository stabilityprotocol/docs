# Example Apps

The following are a list of example dApps created by the Stability Team.

## Stability Account Portal

A platform for creating free accounts to allow you to interact and perform transactions on the Stability Testnet and Global Trust Network. You can create an API key to use with an RPC URL for wallets such as MetaMask or create an account with MagicLink for a wallet-free experience.

For a walkthrough on this process, please visit our [**Getting Started**](../users/getting_started.md) tutorial. If you wish to interact with these apps, be sure to register with Stability Testnet.

The Mintify app demonstrates the simplest web3 onboarding experience in the world today, possible with Stability. This revolutionary proof-of-concept enables a user to log in with an email address and automatically create a brand new, unfunded wallet and mint a digital collectible (NFT) onto the Stability Testnet Blockchain for free. No cryptocurrency, transaction fee, account abstraction, or sponsored transaction required â€” an industry first.

## PayNow - Stability Testnet

The PayNow app demonstrates frictionless peer-to-peer stablecoin payments on Stability Testnet, using names as recipients. These transfers can occur with or without wallets by utilizing MagicLink. By using names as recipients, quick money transfers are as simple as your standard cash app.
